# Lab 04 Report - Licensing

3. You need to choose a license because you need to define permissions on what you create so that others know how to use what you produce. If you want to make money you will want a stricter license, so people can't abuse what you are trying to produce. If you want to produce a free tool, then you need a license that allows that and lets people know what that can do.

4. If something doesn't have a license then you don't know how you are allowed to use it. If you take it thinking it is free, but then the material get copyrighted/licensed in a way that you are breaking that license, then you could possibly face consequences. 

5. I agree that Gopher's my restrictive delelopment model led to its fall. The Gopher team just couldn't keep up with the Web development team, the Web team had more devs, better incentive to make improvements, and was free.

6. It makes sense that Android uses the Apache license 2.0. The OS was designed to be accessible to everyone, they wanted to have make a standard they could be didtributed and used by as many people as possible. "In September, Google announced the first set of Android One phones for release in India" -Wikipedia, they had programs to try to push their OS to other countries. Making the OS open source give them a competitive edge. "Android's source code is released by Google under an open source license, and its open nature has encouraged a large community of developers and enthusiasts to use the open-source code as a foundation for community-driven projects, which deliver updates to older devices, add new features for advanced users or bring Android to devices originally shipped with other operating systems" - Wikipedia, they are letting other people outside the company make advancments to the OS. It also allows 3rd party phone hardware manufactures use the OS, which allows the OS to become more wide spread.

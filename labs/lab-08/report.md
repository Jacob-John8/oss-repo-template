## Checkpoint 2
1) You click on the build you want to look at, then scroll to very bottom of the build page to see a "View Tests Summary".

2) Yes, it shows you exaclty what test failed what the output was and what the expected result is. If you know the code by knowing which test failed you can significantly narrow down the debugging.

3) No, dashboard is clean, I see no issues to be concerned with.
